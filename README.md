# crazyneuraluser

A powerful, the best, domain independent, smart and awesome user model for your system development and evaluation.


## Running baselines

### Environment setup 

In order to set up the necessary environment:

1. Create an environment `neuraluserbaselines` with the help of [conda]:
   ```
   conda env create -f baselines_environment.lock.yml
   ```
2. activate the new environment with:
   ```
   conda activate neuraluserbaselines
   ```

> **_NOTE:_**  The conda environment will have `convlab-2` installed in editable mode - it will appear under `src/convlab-2`.
> **_NOTE:_**  For reproducibility, it is essential to use `baselines_environment.lock.yml` as opposed to `baselines_environment.yml` when creating the environment.


## Installation

The recommended way to use this repository is to develop the core code under `src/crazyneuraluser`. The experiments/exporatory analysis making use of the core 
package code should be placed outside the library and import it. See more guidance under the [Project Organisation](#project-organization) section below.

To create an environment for the package, make sure you have deactivated all `conda` environments. Then:

1. Create an environment `crazyneuraluser` with the help of [conda]:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
2. Add the developer dependencies to this environment with the help of [conda]:
   ```
   conda env update -f dev_environment.yml
   ```
   
Optional and needed only once after `git clone`:

3. install several [pre-commit] git hooks with:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   # You _are encouraged_ to run `pre-commit autoupdate`
   ```
   and checkout the configuration under `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
   The `-n, --no-verify` flag of `git commit` can be used to deactivate pre-commit hooks temporarily.

4. install [nbstripout] git hooks to remove the output cells of committed notebooks with:
   ```bash
   nbstripout --install --attributes notebooks/.gitattributes
   ```
   This is useful to avoid large diffs due to plots in your notebooks.
   A simple `nbstripout --uninstall` will revert these changes.

Then take a look into the `scripts` and `notebooks` folders.

## Dependency Management & Reproducibility

1. Always keep your abstract (unpinned) dependencies updated in `environment.yml` and eventually
   in `setup.cfg` if you want to ship and install your package via `pip` later on.
2. Create concrete dependencies as `environment.lock.yml` for the exact reproduction of your
   environment with:
   ```bash
   conda env export -n crazyneuraluser -f environment.lock.yml
   ```
   For multi-OS development, consider using `--no-builds` during the export.
3. Update your current environment with respect to a new `environment.lock.yml` using:
   ```bash
   conda env update -f environment.lock.yml --prune
   ```
